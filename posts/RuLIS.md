> > "The FAO Statistics Division, the World Bank and IFAD have joined forces to build **RuLIS**, as a tool to support policies for reducing rural poverty. **Information on agricultural** income and rural livelihoods is crucial for the formulation of evidence-based development policies" ([RuLIS website](http://www.fao.org/in-action/rural-livelihoods-dataset-rulis)).

The Rural Livelihood Information System (RuLIS) is a dataset of nationally representative surveys from 37 countries. There are around 280 variables and data is available at the micro-level (e.g., individual farmer responses). It will become open access later this year. 

This interactive app shows all the household variables available, for which countries they are available, and how many survey years for each variable. I am in collaboration with RuLIS to further explore how their dataset can help understand key dimensions of vulnerable farmers and their incomes - an effort to support achieving the [Sustainable Development Goal 2.3](http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators), "doubling the income of small-scale farmers."

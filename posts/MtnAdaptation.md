["Mountain farming is family farming"](http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3480e/i3480e.pdf) and climate change is disrupting the lives of the 915 million people living in mountain areas. 

This [map](https://mtn-adaptation.shinyapps.io/mcdowell_etal_2018/) shows our recent effort to synthesize the scientific literature on how people in mountain regions are adapting. 170 articles documenting over 690  discrete adaptations are represented. Explore the map, links to the  literature, and the different types of methods used in this body of  literature. The underlying data and accompanying article can be found here (link to come):

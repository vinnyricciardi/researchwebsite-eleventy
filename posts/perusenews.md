I've been playing with mining the news lately. 

GDELT is a fascinating news aggregator that aggregates news from 100+ countries every 15 minutes.

Here is a small wrapper to their API I made for my own convienience (and to dabble more with JS). I call the site [Peruse the News](https://peruse-news.netlify.app/).

Feel free to copy and hack my [code](https://github.com/vinnyricciardi/puruse_the_news) for this site.
